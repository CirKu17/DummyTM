{"name":"DummyTM","tagline":"One-page helper for threat modeling tracking.","body":"# DummyTM - Dummy Threat Modeling Tracking\r\n\r\nOne-page helper for threat modeling tracking using the advices of the *[Threat Modeling: Designing for Security](http://threatmodelingbook.com/)* book.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Framework\r\n\r\nIt consists of only two files:\r\n* a diagram (html or image) : represents the system to analyze\r\n* an html document editable in-browser : contains the diagram and a threat table\r\n\r\n\r\n## Workflow\r\n\r\nThe workflow mocks the one treated on the book and includes\r\n* drawing a simple diagram representing the entities forming the system to analyze, along with trust borders, accompanied by notes and indexes\r\n* compiling a threat table with certain attributes during threat identification.\r\n\r\nThe page is largely editable and can be printed (on paper or pdf document) to save it.\r\n\r\n## Diagram\r\n\r\nThe diagram can be drawn as you prefer and imported in the html document.\r\nBy default it expects an html file named `diagram.html` exported with an UML tool like [draw.io](http://draw.io).\r\n\r\nYou can define entities as UML Objects, trust borders as Frames, index elements with subscripts and put notes.\r\nAdd a brief description directly on the diagram to use it separately and edit the text above to introduce the document.\r\n\r\n## Threat Table\r\n\r\nIs an editable html5 table. You can add, remove and move rows (thanks to @ashblue for the design) and should be filled like this:\r\n\r\n**Diagram Element** : the index of the diagram entity to be considered\r\n\r\n**Threat Type** : the [STRIDE](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling#STRIDE) category of the identified threat (a link is provided in-page for consultation)\r\n\r\n **Threat Description** : self-explanatory description\r\n\r\n **Assumption** : a presupposition for how to address the threat (e.g: *It's OK to ignore DoS because there's a backup server*)\r\n\r\n **DREAD Score** : a 0-10 number indicating the risk score according to the [DREAD](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling#DREAD) classification scheme (a link is provided in-page for consultation)\r\n\r\n **Bug Tracking / Vulnerability CVE or CWE** : a bug tracking ID from a bug tracking platform, a CVE ID for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures or a CWE ID for Common Weakness Enumeration.\r\n\r\n The whole table serves the purpose of tracking and addressing the identified threats and giving an immediate feedback of the threat modeling process.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
